# VideoCall-rs

## Description

An open-source, Rust-made video communication software that runs anywhere.

## Goals

* Enable video communication capabilities for everyone.
* Open-source the software so that anyone or any company can build on top of it or integrate it into existing systems.
* Improve its speed and efficiency.
* Make it portable so that it can run anywhere.

## Video Communication Types

**Main Types:**

* One-to-one
* Video conference (webinar)
* Video sharing

**Sub-Types:**

* Live streaming
* Video annotations (adding text, notes, or drawings to videos)
* Interactive video (real-time data that affects the elements over time, treated as video but interactive)
* 360-degree video
* XR (virtual and augmented reality)

## Cool Ideas to Implement on Top of the Main Functionality (Video Communication)

**Hardware:**

* Integrate it into robotics.
* Develop wearable video communication devices.

**AI:**

* Improve video and audio quality.
* Implement an AI video detector to detect and identify elements.
* Implement RTC translation to break the language barrier.
* Implement an AI audio detector for subtitles.
* Implement background noise cancellation.
* Implement virtual backgrounds.
